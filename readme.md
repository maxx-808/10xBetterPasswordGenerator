Homework 3 Javascript: Random Password Generator

For this weeks homework, we had to make a random password generator.

when using my code in a browser, press the button to start the process, it will ask for you to type how long the password will be (8, 9, 10, etc) in terms of character length.

then it will ask through a series of prompts what type of characters you want in it including lower case letters, special characters, numbers, and upper case characters. after that it will tell you how long and what characters will be implemented.

if you did  not type in a digit between 8 and 128 for the password length it will send an error message and return to home screen. if you dont choose any character types it will return to homescreen
